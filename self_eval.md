# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?

I struggled doing the second hashes hw, but I figured it out on my own, which was really satisfying. 

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?

note taking is going well, but sometimes I think I may write down things that are not as important, but then miss things that are. 

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?

I tried to solve the problem on my own by looking at my notes, then I tried google if I was stuck for too long
